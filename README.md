**Problem Statement:**

    We will study the research done by Professor Intriligator and Professor
    Fadardi on visual attention retraining to create a game that will translate
    the experimental results into real-life end users!

**Sponsor**

    Professor James Intriligator & Professor Javad Salehi Fadardi: They have
    conducted copious amounts of research over the past decades on addition,
    visual attention, and how to combat it. They have implemented prototypes
    that gamify visual attention retraining, and have gotten satisfactory
    results on par with experimental research outcomes. They are looking to
    take the game to the next level and have it more readily available across
    different platforms, such as iOS, Android, and web.
    
**Background**

    Visual attention and addiction go hand in hand, and many rehabilitations
    go south when the individual visually locks into the object (alcohol) and
    automatically/subconsciously relapses. This is a major issue across all
    types of addictions, and may even be helpful towards implementing healthy
    habits.
    
**Problem**

    The research done by Professor Fadardi can be applied towards
    someone recovering from substance abuse, but also towards someone wishing
    to eat healthier foods. This fills a need in today’s society, where every
    single object is designed to get you hooked, from the good ol’ alcohol
    and cigarette to social media and screen time, there is an unmet need of
    detoxification from these dopamine blackholes, and this project will
    ideally meet that need.
    
**Stakeholders**

    Professor Lillethun
    Clients: Professor Intriligator & Professor Fadardi
    Team members: Shona Horton, Ayah Harper, Michael Hu, Michael Zhou
    End users: anyone looking to practice intentional visual attention to
               improve their quality of life.
**Key Challenges**

    Well-defined specifications
    Well-defined scope
    Organized file management
    Coordinated and continuous contribution to the project

**Scope**

    In Scope:
        We will be in charge of the App/Website design and implementation
        We will be in charge of the game mechanics that facilitate the
        retraining
        We will be in charge of development and testing of our software
        We will be in charge of any creative artistic liberties in our game
        to garner engagement
        We will only design the game for one platform
    Out of Scope:
        We will not work on marketing and selling the game
        We will not improve upon the existing research
        We will not be making a multiplayer game
        We will not be in charge of pricing or subscription model of the game
        We will not design the game for multiple platforms

**Success Criteria**

    Design and implement a fully functional game that can be improved upon by
    future cohorts if necessary
    Provide necessary documentation on our process
